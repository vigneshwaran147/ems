/**
 * Strips transient request-lifecycle flags before they reach localStorage.
 *
 * `isLoading` / `error` / `success` are true only for the lifetime of an
 * in-flight request. If the request never settles — e.g. the network drops
 * before it errors — and the persisted slice still has `isLoading: true` on
 * disk, a page refresh rehydrates that stale `true` with no request left to
 * ever flip it back. A submit button bound to it (see LoginPage) then stays
 * disabled/spinning forever, until the user manually clears storage.
 *
 * `inbound` runs on the way INTO storage: dropping the keys here means they
 * are simply absent from what's written. On rehydration redux-persist merges
 * the persisted object over the slice's initialState (autoMergeLevel1), so a
 * missing key leaves the freshly-booted `false` / `null` untouched instead of
 * being overwritten by a stale value.
